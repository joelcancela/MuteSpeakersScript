# MuteSpeakersScript

Just a simple script that mutes the speakers (works only for French Windows).
To make this work in your language, you'll have to change this line and put the name of your speak device instead https://github.com/joelcancela/MuteSpeakersScript/blob/fbf26eb61b144c3618c19fee2202dc304b684e08/MuteSpeakersScript/Program.cs#L22

I'm using it to mute the speakers when the system starts.

## Install

* Compile it
* Put the executable in one of the following startup folders :
    * Windows 10 Startup folder for current user

    ```text
    C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
    ```

    * Windows 10 Startup folder for all users

    ```text
    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
    ```
